			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 10px;">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).</p>
			<p>In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers<br> and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body.<br> Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerves.</p>

				<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; color: orange">Symptoms</h3>
				<ul style="margin: 20px;">
					<li>Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or your legs and trunk</li>
					<li>Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign)</li>
					<li>Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait</li>

				<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; color: orange">Risk Factors</h3>
				<ul style="margin: 20px;">
					<li>Age : MS can occur at any age, but onset usually occurs around 20 and 40 years of age. However, younger and older people can be affected.</li>
					<li>Sex : Women are more than two to three times as likely as men are to have relapsing-remitting MS.</li>
					<li>Family history : If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease.</li>
					<li>Certain infections : A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis.</li>
					<li>Race : White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk.</li>
					<li>Vitamin D : Having low levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight is associated with a greater risk of MS.</li>
					<li>Smoking : Smokers who experience an initial event of symptoms that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting MS.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 style="margin: 20px;">Myelin Sheath</h3>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Myelin sheaths are sleeves of fatty tissue that protect your nerve cells.<br> These cells are part of your central nervous system, which carries messages back and forth between your brain and the rest of your body.<br><br>
				If you have multiple sclerosis your myelin sheaths can be damaged.<br>That means your nerves won't be able to send and receive messages as they should.<br><br>
				Because of this, MS can weaken your muscles, damage your coordination, and, in the worst cases, paralyze you.<br> MS affects about 1 million Americans, and it usually shows up between ages 20 and 50. It's not clear what causes it, and there's no known cure.<br></p>
